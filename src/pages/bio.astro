          I strive to capture a range of different styles and techniques around
          my home and some travel. I really enjoy nature, people, and all sorts
          of things. Sometimes I chase golden hour light, but not always. I find
          that sometimes the subject and place are more important than the time
          of day. Even though light and shadows can be harsh, that just adds to
          the scene.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Although I don't remember the first time I picked up a camera, I do
          remember that I knew that this is a passion to be followed. I see the
          improvement in my work in comparison to my earlier images. Photography
          is a practice, even if some people have a better starting point.
